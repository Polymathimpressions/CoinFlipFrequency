## Overview

The purpose of this presentation is to highlight my RStudio shiny application that I developed as the final project for Coursera's Developing Data Products Course.  The application can be used to demonstrate the concept of cumulative frequency over a differing number of outcomes by utilizing a very basic, non-biased coin flip model.  
## Application Features

- An input slider that can be adjusted from 10 to 10,000 outcomes (flips of the coin)
- As the slider is adjusted, an interactive plotly line plot is displayed as a result of server calculations
- An orange reference line is displayed at 0.5 frequency equal to the probability of a non-biased coin

The App can be found at https://everydaypolymath.shinyapps.io/CoinFlipCumulativeFrequency/
ui.R and server.R can be found at 

## UI Code
The below code was writen to develope the user interface.
```{r UIcode, echo = FALSE}
#load packages
library(shiny)
library(plotly)

# Define UI for application that draws a line plot
shinyUI(fluidPage(

    # Application title
    titlePanel("Cumulative Frequency of Heads in Coin Flip"),

    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            h4("By adjusting the number of outcomes, the plot will display the cumulative frequency for the outcome of heads."),
            sliderInput("flips",
                        "Select Number of Flips:",
                        min = 10,
                        max = 10000,
                        value = 100)
        ),

        # Show a plot of the cumulative frequency
        mainPanel(
            plotlyOutput(outputId= "headsplot"), width = 8
        )
    )
))
```

## Server Code
The below code runs the functions to create the displayed plot.  
```{r server, echo=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(plotly)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
shinyServer(function(input, output) {

    output$headsplot <- renderPlotly({

        # generate outcomes based on input$flips from ui.R
        set.seed(888)
        coin<- c("heads","tails")
        num_flips<- input$flips
        outcomes<- sample(coin, size = num_flips, replace = TRUE)
        
        #calculate Cumulative Frequency of Heads
        heads_freq <- cumsum(outcomes == 'heads') / 1:num_flips

        # draw the line plot with the specified number of flips
        plot_ly(x=1:num_flips,y=heads_freq, type = "scatter", mode="lines") %>%
            layout(title="Cumulative Frequency of Heads", 
                   xaxis=list(showgrid=T, zeroline=T, nticks=0, showline=T, title="Flip Index"),
                   yaxis=list(nticks=10, title="Relative Frequency")) %>%
            add_segments(x =0 , xend = num_flips, y = 0.5, yend = 0.5)%>%
            hide_legend()
    })

})

```
