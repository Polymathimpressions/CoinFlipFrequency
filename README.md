# CoinFlipFrequency
 Cumulative Frequency of Heads in a coin flip shiny app.

The application can be used to demonstrate the concept of cumulative frequency over a differing number of outcomes by utilizing a very basic, non-biased coin flip model.  
## Application Features

- An input slider that can be adjusted from 10 to 10,000 outcomes (flips of the coin)
- As the slider is adjusted, an interactive plotly line plot is displayed as a result of server calculations
- An orange reference line is displayed at 0.5 frequency equal to the probability of a non-biased coin
